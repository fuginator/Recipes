# Recipes

This git repo is intended to hold various recipes in an easy to access, text
based format that is easy to share with my nerdy friends as well as easy to
access and share by my family.

All too often I find a recipe online that I try out, find it's quite good, then
promptly loose any reference to it.  By having this collection here, I hope to
keep track of the gems I find and like.
