- 5 Lbs.	 Pork Butt

### Cooking Items Needed:
- Bake Pan (8x13)
- Blender
- Large zip-lock bag (1 Lb.)
- Something to process spices in, coffee bean grinder works well

Directions:
-----------

1. Combine everything under 'Raw Seeds' in coffee bean grinder, grind until it
becomes a smooth powder - may take 20 min plus of grinding, re-mixing, etc.

2. Combine everything under 'Other Items' in blender, plus powder from step 1,
blend until well mixed, this is now your marinade

3. Cut pork into 2 inch cubes, removing excess fat, place meat in bag, add
marinade created in step 2, refrigerate for 48 hours

4. Line bake dish with aluminum foil, place banana leaves in pan in such a
fashion you can 'wrap' the meat when placed in pan - be sure to leave some
extra to put extra layer on top.  Place meat in banana leaves, should be enough
to be 1 to 1.5 inches deep of meat and marinade.  Finish the wrap job with leaf
parts hanging over, and put any remaining leaf parts on top.  Use toothpicks to
secure if needed.

5. Bake 4 hours at 350, remove, let sit 5 min before removing leaves to avoid
burning your hands from the steam - Enjoy


Goes well with rice - even white - sour cream - and - chopped white onion
